This little exercise was part of an interview process to http://www.salsitasoft.com/ .

If you are interested whether I succeded and got the job-then no, they did not like it that much. 
The feedback was(to revision 3):
- The code is more complex than it needs to be for the task at hand.
- The structure is a bit inelegant.
- It has almost no comments and no tests.
- There is commented out code.
- Backbone features like the 'events' hash are not used and passing the model to initialize is unnecessary (Backbone assigns it to the view automatically).
- The implementation is fairly buggy. I pointed out once issue to you, but I still get weird results if I do e.g. 3x3=+2= (I would expect 11 but your implementation gives 29).
